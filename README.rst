An attempt to document the characters needed for (old) Polish texts.
Work in progress. Volunteers help is welcome.

The primary idea was to use the form of wiki, but it appeared
cumbersome and will not be continued. Some useful links are now stored at 
https://www.zotero.org/groups/2196114/unicode_for_polish.

The textel names are to be used with unihistext
(https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/unihistext/).

A similar development was carried also on
at https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/parkosz-font/.
