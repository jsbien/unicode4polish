An attempt to document the characters needed for (old) Polish texts.
Work in progress. Volunteers to help are welcome.

The primary idea was to use the form of wiki, but it appeared
cumbersome and, at least in principle, will not be continued.

For the time being a similar development is carried also on
at https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/parkosz-font/.
